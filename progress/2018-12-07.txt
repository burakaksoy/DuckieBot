Today we started to creating new nodes with ARUCO tags.
So First we need to launch camera.launch:
roslaunch duckietown camera.launch veh:=duckiepark raw:=true rect:=true

Then we need to launch our aruco_test.launch:
roslaunch duckietown aruco_test.launch markerId:=50 markerSize:=0.07

Too see the output image we used 
rqt_image_view
To see the pose info we used
rostopic echo /aruco_single/pose

We realized that Aruco Detection is a little bit slow, to increase the rate, we decided to try to run it inside duckie instead of our computer.
Therefore We installed aruco_ros package in duckie too. 

Then, we created a launch file which will run aruco in duckie which is duckietown/aruco_test_in_duckie.launch

roslaunch duckietown aruco_test_in_duckie.launch veh:=duckiepark markerId:=50 markerSize:=0.07

As result, aruco detection was more slow while running in duckie because of the detection is computationally more costly than just transmitting the raw images to our computer. 
So we stick with aruco_test.launch instead aruco_test_in_duckie.launch


We will create a package and a new node in it:
Subscribes to:
    /aruco_single/pose
Publishes:
    /car_cmd
