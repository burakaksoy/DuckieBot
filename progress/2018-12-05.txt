We made calibration again
So copied calibration files

Launching the camera
burak@buraka:~$ roslaunch duckietown camera.launch veh:=duckiepark raw:=true rect:=true

Install aruco-ros with command:
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-aruco-ros

We created a launch file in src/duckietown named aruco_test.launch
using the reference from website: http://ros-developer.com/2017/04/23/aruco-ros/

<remap from="/camera_info" to="/duckiepark/camera_node/raw_camera_info" />
<remap from="/image" to="/duckiepark/camera_node/image/rect" />
<param name="image_is_rectified" value="True"/>

<remap from="/camera_info" to="/duckiepark/camera_node/raw_camera_info" />
<remap from="/image" to="/duckiepark/camera_node/image/raw" />
<param name="image_is_rectified" value="False"/>

-------------------------------------

After successfully detecitng the aruco tag and calculating the pose we returned back to lane tracking 
It was not working before. Since we made the calibrations again, we wanted give it a one more shot for our further steps.

So we checked the duckietown/joystick.launch file and saw that it runs
<!-- joy_mapper -->
<!-- run inverse_kinematics_node -->
<!-- run forward_kinematics_node -->
<!-- run the velocity_to_pose_node -->
<!-- Wheels Driver -->

The details of the messages can be seen in image named '2018-12-05-12-24-joystick-rosgraph.png'

So we will check the joy_mapper to see how they publish the appropriate message.
Accordingly we will create our own nodes
And the last 4 launch lines above will be exactly the same in our future launch file.
