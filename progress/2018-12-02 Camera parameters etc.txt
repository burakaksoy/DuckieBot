1. To get image/compressed we need to camera_node.launch in catkin_ws/src/pi_camera which will launch camera_node_sequence.py
This file specifies the intrinsic calibration file that we need to use in line 44

Extrinsic and Intrnsic parameters stored in Duckiebot directory:
ubuntu@duckiepark:~/duckietown/catkin_ws/src/duckietown/config/baseline/calibration
In this directory there are extrinsic parameters folder and file
camera_extrinsic/duckiepark.yaml
And Intrinsic parameters folder
camera_intrinsic/duckiepark.yaml

We copied those files to our computers too with commands
For example:
~/duckietown/catkin_ws/src/duckietown/config/baseline/calibration/camera_intrinsic$ scp duckiepark.yaml burak@buraka:~/duckietown/catkin_ws/src/duckietown/config/baseline/calibration/camera_intrinsic
And change folder names to camera_extrinscic for copying the extrinsic file too

To access to necessary topics for Aruco detection we need to launch camera.launch in duckietown package
This launch file can publish topics
/duckiepark/camera_node/image/compressed
/duckiepakr/camera_node/camera_info

Then we cloned the aruco_detect package from github
ubuntu@duckiepark:~/duckietown/catkin_ws/src$ git clone -b indigo-devel https://github.com/UbiquityRobotics/fiducials.git

Catkin_make gave compiling errors This was the error:
	"
	CMake Error at /opt/ros/indigo/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:83 (find_package):
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "angles" with any
  of the following names:

    anglesConfig.cmake
    angles-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "angles" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "angles_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "angles"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed. "

So to solve: sudo apt-install ros-indigo-angles

Then we applied catkin_make again we got no errors.

After catkin_make do not forget to 
ubuntu@duckiepark:~/duckietown/catkin_ws$ source devel/setup.bash

To make the duckie master itself
ubuntu@duckiepark:~$ source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash 
ubuntu@duckiepark:~$ cd duckietown/catkin_ws/
ubuntu@duckiepark:~/duckietown/catkin_ws$ source devel/setup.bash


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To remotely ruyn the detection from our own computers we also installed the fiducialpackage to our computers
and we need to create a new lunch file to make the packages run from remote computer but inside duckie.
